# PostgreSQL Practice Project (First Principles)

This project is a **hands-on practice backend** built to understand **PostgreSQL from first principles**, without relying on ORMs initially.  
The goal is to learn how real backend systems interact with relational databases using **raw SQL, migrations, and proper configuration**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- Understand how PostgreSQL works at a fundamental level
- Learn how database **migrations** manage schema changes
- Work with **raw SQL queries** using Node.js
- Avoid abstraction-heavy tools at the beginning
- Build a solid foundation before moving to ORMs for faster shipping

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn by **building**, not watching
- Use documentation, experimentation, and AI as a learning assistant
- Avoid tutorial hell
- Choose tools based on **problem requirements**, not popularity

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Migrations:** dbmate
- **Database Driver:** pg (node-postgres)
- **Environment Config:** dotenv

_No ORM is used in this phase._
